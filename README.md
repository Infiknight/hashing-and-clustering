The present codebase includes implementations of the following in C:
- Locality Sensitive Hashing based on Euclidean, Hamming, Manhattan and Cosine metrics
- Distance Based Hashing
- k-medoids clustering (specifically Partitioning Around Medoids) where the Assignment step uses the aformentioned hashing algorithms
- Silhouette by P. J. Rousseeuw for validating the consistency within clusters of data
- Nearest Neighbor Recommendation based on Locality Sensitive Hashing
- Recommendation based on clustering
- Applying k-medoids clustering on molecular conformations

Much of the above begun as a school project and were later expanded upon. It is currently a work in progress.
